# Evaluator Report Summary

## Verdicts Across 48 Skeptic Concerns

- **13 VALID** — the skeptic nailed real problems
- **30 PARTIALLY VALID** — real issues but overstated severity or mischaracterized the project's position
- **5 INVALID**
- **19 severity downgrades** from the skeptic's ratings

## The Skeptic's Strongest Point

Governance circularity (C-25/C-26) — the evidence package is produced by the same system being validated, with no independent check.

## The Skeptic's Weakest Argument

The "chasm" framing — it repeatedly measures the 120-day progressive plan against the 50,000-job vision instead of against the actual phased targets.

## Tier 1 — Must Do Before First Real-Platform Experiment (3 Items)

1. Comparison strategies for each of the 6 output targets
2. Human spot-check protocol to break governance circularity
3. Cost model

## Tier 2 — Address During Execution (5 Items)

1. Redesign comparison loop for scale
2. Build Strategy Doc
3. Classify jobs by output characteristics
4. Workaround audits
5. Security controls

## Tier 3 — Monitor (7 Items)

1. Anti-pattern guide completeness
2. Context window management
3. Reviewer quality
4. Test plan execution
5. Rollback planning
6. Agent Teams maturity
7. Timeline tracking

## Bottom Line

**Proceed with modifications.** The POC proves real capability, the progressive scaling approach is sound, but the three Tier 1 items are non-negotiable.
